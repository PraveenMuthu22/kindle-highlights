There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing.

They had rushed the product to market and had made a huge mess in the code. As they added more and more features, the code got worse and worse until they simply could not manage it any longer. It was the bad code that brought the company down.

No. The managers and marketers look to us for the information they need to make promises and commitments; and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy about telling them what we think. The users look to us to validate the way the requirements will fit into the system

clean code is pleasing to read. Reading it should make you smile the way a well-crafted music box or well-designed car would.

Each function, each class, each module exposes a single-minded attitude that remains entirely undistracted, and unpolluted, by the surrounding details.

Clean code never obscures the designer’s intent but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.

When the same thing is done over and over, it’s a sign that there is an idea in our mind that is not well represented in the code.

After years of doing this work, it seems to me that all programs are made up of very similar elements. One example is “find things in a collection.”

It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We’ve all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this degradation. The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule that we can apply to our profession. Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.5 5. This was adapted from Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell’s farewell message to the Scouts: “Try and leave this world a little better than you found it…” If we all checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out, the code simply could not rot.

The cleanup doesn’t have to be something big. Change one variable name for the better, break up one function that’s a little too large, eliminate one small bit of duplication, clean up one composite if statement.

int d; // elapsed time in days The name d reveals nothing. It does not evoke a sense of elapsed time, nor of days. We should choose a name that specifies what is being measured and the unit of that measurement:    int elapsedTimeInDays;    int daysSinceCreation;    int daysSinceModification;    int fileAgeInDays;

It still has exactly the same number of operators and constants, with exactly the same number of nesting levels. But the code has become much more explicit.

We can go further and write a simple class for cells instead of using an array of ints. It can include an intention-revealing function (call it isFlagged) to hide the magic numbers. It results in a new version of the function:    public List<Cell> getFlaggedCells() {      List<Cell> flaggedCells = new ArrayList<Cell>();      for (Cell cell : gameBoard)        if (cell.isFlagged())          flaggedCells.add(cell);      return flaggedCells;    }
