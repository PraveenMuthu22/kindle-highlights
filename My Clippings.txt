What you have said is utterly contemptible. You tell us, when war and battle are well under way, to drag our splendid galleys back to sea, and when the Trojans are already winning you want to make their every wish come true, and let catastrophe descend on us— 100 because while we are dragging ships to sea,

the Greeks will not stay focused on the battle. Distracted, they will lose their will to fight. 130 Your strategy will ruin us, commander.” Then Agamemnon, lord of men, replied, “Odysseus, the harshness of your scolding touches me deeply, in my very heart. I shall not tell the sons of Greece to drag the galleys to the sea against their will. But now let somebody articulate a better plan than mine. I would be glad to hear it, from a young or older man.”

The sea surged up towards the huts and ships. The armies clashed with a tumultuous cry. Louder than roaring of the waves on shore, when cruel blasts of Boreas have stirred the deepest water, louder than the rumble of blazing fire that leaps to burn a forest within the thickets on the mountainside, louder than wind that shrieks through lofty oak trees, which roars the loudest when it rages most— louder than all of these, the Greeks and Trojans 400 530 let out their terrifying screams and cries as they attacked each other.

If you are being honest with me now, and telling me the truth, go join the gods and summon Iris. Let her go among the army of the Greeks bedecked in bronze and tell Poseidon he must quit the war and go back to his own house.

Hector, out in front of Troy, 90 will kill Patroclus with his spear, and then, enraged at this, Achilles will kill Hector. And after that has happened, I shall cause the Greeks to drive the Trojans from the ships, 70 and force them to retreat continuously until, through great Athena’s strategies, the Greeks have seized the lofty town of Troy. Until that time, my anger will not cease. No other deathless god will be allowed to help the Greeks until I have fulfilled 100 the wishes of the son of Peleus, Achilles, as I promised I would do, and nodded with my head to make it certain, the day the goddess Thetis touched my knees imploring me to glorify Achilles, the city-sacker.”

And then Briseis, who shone as bright as golden Aphrodite, saw that Patroclus had been killed with bronze, and wrapped herself around him with a wail 370 and scratched her breasts, soft neck, and pretty face. The woman, looking like a goddess, wept, and said, “Patroclus, in my desperate plight I loved you most. I left you here alive, and I come back here now to find you dead, after you led the troops to war. For me, 290 one trouble always follows on another. I saw the man to whom my parents gave me cut down before our city with sharp bronze, along with my three brothers, whom I loved. 380 All of us shared one father and one mother, all of them slaughtered on a single day. But you—when swift Achilles killed my husband and sacked the city of divine King Munes, you would not let me weep at all. You said

that you would make me be the lawful wife of godlike Lord Achilles, and that you would take me back to Phthia on his ship and there among the Myrmidons arrange a wedding feast to celebrate my marriage. 390 So I will weep for you unceasingly 300 now you are dead—because you always were so kind to me.” She spoke these words in tears, and all the other women wailed in answer. Using the lamentation for Patroclus, each of the women wept for their own troubles. The older Greek men gathered round Achilles, and begged him to eat something. He refused, groaning with grief, and said,

Then swift-footed Lord Achilles would have killed even more Paeonians, but then the swirling river, in a fury, spoke to him, taking on a human form, and from his eddying depths called out, 280 “Achilles, you are more powerful than other men, more capable of doing dreadful harm. The gods are constantly protecting you, but even if great Zeus, the son of Cronus, enables you to slaughter all the Trojans, at least drive them away from me. Perform your horrifying actions on the plain. My lovely streams have been clogged up with corpses. I cannot freely pour my waters down 290 into the shining sea, because the bodies

choke me, yet you keep killing even more, 220 annihilating everyone. Come on, leader of troops, stop now! This is too much.” Swift-footed Lord Achilles answered him, “It will be as you say, divine Scamander. But I will massacre these arrogant Trojans, not stopping till I trap them in their city and fight with Hector, man to man, and see if he defeats me or I conquer him.” 300 Then like a god he rushed against the Trojans. The eddying deep river told Apollo, “God of the silver bow, offspring of Zeus, 230 you failed to implement your father’s plans. The son of Cronus earnestly advised you to stand beside the Trojans and protect them until at last the sun begins to set and spreads its shadows on the fertile fields.” But then the famed spear warrior, Achilles, jumped off the bank and plunged into the water.

The river surged and swelled and rushed against him, swirling and gathering his streams together to sweep away the multitude of corpses that blocked his waters, from the many people killed by Achilles. Roaring like a bull, the river hurled them out onto the land. He saved the people who were still alive, hiding them underneath his lovely streams among the whirling eddies of his depths. Gurgling horribly, a wave rose up 240 320 around Achilles, and the blast of water battered against his shield and thrust him back. He lost his footing, and his hands reached out to clutch a stately, well-grown elm, and ripped it out by the roots, and the whole riverbank fell with the fallen tree. Thick branches blocked the fresh, free-flowing waters, and the trunk, completely fallen in the riverbed, dammed up the current. And Achilles rose out of the swirling stream and sprinted off 330 across the plain, quick as his feet would go, terrified. But the great god did not stop. His surface water darkened as he surged and swelled towards Achilles, in his effort

to stop him and to save the Trojans’ lives. The son of Peleus went dashing back, as far as spears can fly, as fast as when the swift black eagle swoops to catch his prey— the strongest and the swiftest of all birds— like this, Achilles darted back, his armor 340 clashing and clattering around his body. He fled, bent down beneath the rushing river, flooding behind him with a mighty roar. As when, to make an irrigation channel by guiding water from a deep, dark spring onto his plants and trees, a worker uses a mattock to remove the obstacles— 260 the water gushes forth and all the pebbles are swept away, and gurgling as it goes the stream flows down the slope, soon overtaking 350 the man who made it—so the flooding river kept catching up, however fast he ran. Gods are superior to human beings. And every time Achilles tried to stand and face the river and find out if all the deathless gods were forcing him to flee, including the inhabitants of heaven, a billowing deluge of the Zeus-fed river

If I go back inside the gates, behind the city wall, 100 Polydamas will be the first to heap shame on my head. He told me I should lead the Trojans back to Troy that fatal night, when glorious Achilles had arisen. 140 It would have been far better if I had, but I refused. And now I have destroyed my people by my recklessness and folly, and so I am ashamed to face the Trojans, both men and women in their trailing dresses, in case some man of lower rank than me says, ‘Hector trusted his own strength too much, and so destroyed his troops.’ They will say this. So it would be far better for me now to meet Achilles face to face and kill him 150 before I go back home again, or else 110 to die with glory, in defense of Troy.

What if I promise we will give all this 160 back to the sons of Atreus, and also provide more wealth for all the Greeks to share— everything that our citadel contains? What if I make the Trojans swear an oath 120 not to hide anything, but offer all the wealth inside our lovely town to them? But no! Why did my mind suggest these things? I cannot face him as a supplicant. He will not pity me or show respect. He will kill me unarmed, just like a woman, 170 if I set down my weapons on the ground. I think there is no way, from oak or rock, to chat with him as girl and boy might do, a girl and boy who chat and flirt together.

He had just finished with his food and wine. The table was still at his side. Great Priam came in unnoticed. He stood near Achilles, 590 and touched his knees and kissed his hands—the terrible, murderous hands, which killed so many sons. As when delusion seizes hold of someone 470 who kills a man in his own fatherland, and comes to a community of strangers, and goes inside the house of a rich man, and everyone who sees him there is shocked, so was Achilles shocked when he saw Priam appearing like a god.

In spacious Troy, I had the finest sons, of whom not one is left. I once had fifty, in the days before the Greeks arrived. And from one womb nineteen were born to me.

I had just one who kept our town and people safe, and you killed him a short while ago, 490 620 while he was fighting for his fatherland— Hector.

Then both remembered those whom they had lost. 500 Curled in a ball beside Achilles’ feet Priam sobbed desperately for murderous Hector.

Stop now, old man, or else I will not spare you, although you are a suppliant in my tent, 560 710 and I would violate the laws of Zeus.” So spoke Achilles.

Achilles leapt up like a lion and dashed out the door— not by himself but with his two attendants, warlike Automedon and Alcimus, the comrades whom he held in greatest honor after Patroclus died. Then they unyoked the horses and the mules, and led inside the herald who accompanied old Priam, 720 and seated him. Then from the polished wagon they brought the boundless ransom for the head 570 of Hector. But they left a fine-spun tunic and two cloths, so Achilles could wrap up the corpse before he gave it to the Trojans to take back home.

The women washed him and anointed him with olive oil and dressed him in the tunic and wrapped him in a fine cloth. Then Achilles lifted him up himself and set him down 580 upon a bier, and with his comrades raised it onto the polished wagon.

Enkidu said, “But how can any man dare to enter the Cedar Forest? It is sacred to Enlil. Hasn’t he declared its entrance forbidden, hasn’t he put Humbaba there to terrify men? We must not go on this journey, we must not fight this creature. His breath spews fire, his voice booms like thunder, his jaws are death. He can hear all sounds in the forest, even the faintest

rustling among the leaves, he will hear us a hundred miles away. Who among men or gods could defeat him? Humbaba is the forest’s guardian, Enlil put him there to terrify men. Whoever enters will be struck down by fear.”

We are not gods, we cannot ascend to heaven. No, we are mortal men. Only the gods live forever.Our days are few in number, and whatever we achieve is a puff of wind. Why be afraid then, since sooner or later death must come? Where is the courage you have always had? If I die in the forest on this great adventure, won’t you be ashamed when people say, ‘Gilgamesh met a hero’s death battling the monster Humbaba. And where was Enkidu? He was safe at home!’ You were raised in the mountains, with your own hands you have killed marauding lions and wolves, you are brave, your heart has been tested in combat. But whether you come along or not, I will cut down the tree, I will kill Humbaba, I will make a lasting name for myself, I will stamp my fame on men’s minds forever.”

“Lord of heaven, you have granted my son beauty and strength and courage-why have you burdened him with a restless heart? Now you have stirred him up to attack the monster Humbaba, to make a long journey from which he may not return.

“I know you, Gilgamesh. Don’t be a fool. Go away. Leave the Cedar Forest. Have madmen told you to confront me here? I will tear you limb from limb, I will crush you and leave you bloody and mangled on the ground. And you, Enkidu, you son of a fish or a turtle, you gutless, fatherless spawn who never suckled on mother’s milk, I saw you in the pastures when you were young, I saw you graze with the wandering herds but I didn’t kill you, you were too scrawny, you wouldn’t have made a decent meal. And now you dare to lead Gilgamesh here, you both stand before me looking like a pair of frightened girls. I will slit your throats, I will cut off your heads, I will feed your stinking guts to the shrieking vultures and crows.”

Gilgamesh backed away. He said, “How dreadful Humbaba’s face has become! It is changing into a thousand nightmare faces, more horrible than I can bear. I feel haunted. I am too afraid to go on.”

Humbaba said, “Gilgamesh, have mercy. Let me live here in the Cedar Forest. If you spare my life, I will be your slave, I will give you as many cedars as you wish. You are king of Uruk by the grace of Shamash, honor him with a cedar temple and a glorious cedar palace for yourself. All this is yours, if only you spare me.” Enkidu said, “Dear friend, don’t listen to anything that the

monster says. Kill him before you become confused.” Humbaba said, “If any mortal, Enkidu, knows the rules of my forest, it is you. You know that this is my place and that I am the forest’s guardian. Enlil put me here to terrify men, and I guard the forest as Enlil ordains. If you kill me, you will call down the gods’ wrath, and their judgment will be severe. I could have killed you at the forest’s edge, I could have hung you from a cedar and fed your guts to the shrieking vultures and crows. Now it is your turn to show me mercy. Speak to him, beg him to spare my life.”

Enkidu said, “Dear friend, quickly, before another moment goes by, kill Humbaba, don’t listen to his words, don’t hesitate, slaughter him, slit his throat, before the great god Enlil can stop us, before the great gods can get enraged, Enlil in Nippur, Shamash in Larsa. Establish your fame, so that forever men will speak of brave Gilgamesh, who killed Humbaba in the Cedar Forest.”

When at last they arrived, Gilgamesh said to Urshanabi, “This is the wall of Uruk, which no city on earth can equal. See how its ramparts gleam like copper in the sun. Climb the stone staircase, more ancient than the mind can imagine, approach the Eanna Temple, sacred to Ishtar, a temple that no king has equaled in size or beauty, walk on the wall of Uruk, follow its course around the city, inspect its mighty foundations, examine its brickwork, how masterfully it is built, observe the land it encloses: the palm trees, the gardens, the orchards, the glorious palaces and temples, the shops and marketplaces, the

“Ea said to the counselor Enlil, ‘You, the wisest and bravest of the gods, how did it happen that you so recklessly sent the Great Flood to destroy mankind? It is right to punish the sinner for his sins, to punish the criminal for his crime, but be merciful, do not allow all men to die because of the sins of some. Instead of a flood, you should have sent lions to decimate the human race, or wolves, or a famine, or a deadly plague. As for my taking the solemn oath, I didn’t reveal the secret of the gods, I only whispered it to a fence and Utnapishtim happened to hear. Now you must decide what his fate will be.’

“At the first glow of dawn, an immense black cloud rose on the horizon and crossed the sky. Inside it the storm god Adad was thundering, while Shullat and Hanish, twin gods of destruction, went first, tearing through mountains and valleys. Nergal, the god of pestilence, ripped out the dams of the Great Deep, Ninurta opened the floodgates of heaven, the infernal gods blazed and set the whole land on fire. A deadly silence spread through the sky and what had been bright now turned to darkness. The land was shattered like a clay pot. All day, ceaselessly, the storm winds blew, the rain fell, then the Flood burst forth, overwhelming the people like war. No one could see through the rain, it fell harder and harder, so thick that you couldn’t see your own hand before your eyes. Even the gods were afraid. The water rose higher and higher until the gods fled to Anu’s palace in the highest heaven. But Anu had shut the gates. The gods cowered by the palace wall, like dogs. “Sweet-voiced Aruru, mother of men, screamed out, like a woman in childbirth: ‘If only that day had never been, when I spoke up for evil in the council of the gods! How could I have agreed to destroy my children by sending the Great Flood upon them? I have given birth to the human race, only to see them fill the ocean like fish.’ The other gods were lamenting with her. They sat and listened to her and wept. Their lips were parched, crusted with scabs.

Gilgamesh said to Utnapishtim, “I imagined that you would look like a god. But you look like me, you are not any different. I intended to fight you, yet now that I stand before you, now that I see who you are, I can’t fight, something is holding me back.

King of Shuruppak, quickly, quickly tear down your house and build a great ship, leave your possessions, save your life. The ship must be square, so that its length equals its width. Build a roof over it, just as the Great Deep is covered by the earth. Then gather and take aboard the ship examples of every living creature.’

“Yes: the gods took Enkidu’s life. But man’s life is short, at any moment it can be snapped, like a reed in a canebrake. The handsome young man, the lovely young woman—in their prime, death comes and drags them away. Though no one has seen death’s face or heard death’s voice, suddenly, savagely, death destroys us, all of us, old or young. And yet we build houses, make contracts, brothers divide their inheritance, conflicts occur—as though this human life lasted forever. The river rises, flows over its banks and carries us all away, like mayflies floating downstream: they stare at the sun, then all at once there is nothing.

When the gods created mankind, they also created death, and they held back eternal life for themselves alone. Humans are born, they live, then they die, this is the order that the gods have decreed. But until the end comes, enjoy your life, spend it in happiness, not despair.

Savor your food, make each of your days a delight, bathe and anoint yourself, wear bright clothes that are sparkling clean, let music and dancing fill your house, love the child who holds you by the hand, and give your wife pleasure in your embrace. That is the best way for a man to live.”
