First Telamonian Ajax, like a rampart protecting the Greek troops, broke through the line of Trojans, bringing light to his companions. He struck the finest of the Thracian fighters, the son of Eussorus, strong Acamas. 10 He hit the crest-piece of his horsehair plume. 10 The bronze tip stabbed between his eyes and pierced into his skull, and darkness veiled his sight. Then Diomedes, master of the war cry, slaughtered the son of Teuthras, Axylus, who used to live in beautiful Arisbe. He had a rich estate and wealthy home, and everybody loved him. He was kind,

and generous and welcomed everyone who passed that way as guests inside his home. 20 None of his friends stepped in to help him now. No one protected him from bitter death. His life was taken. Diomedes killed Axylus and his man Calesius, the driver of his chariot and horses. So both those men sank down upon the earth.

Then Menelaus shouted and seized a prisoner alive— Adrastus, when his horses fled in panic across the plain and ran into a branch of tamarisk.

Adrastus toppled from the chariot and fell flat with his mouth down in the dust. Then Menelaus, son of Atreus, 60 straddled him, with his spear grasped in his hand. Adrastus grabbed his knees and pleaded with him.

“Please, son of Atreus, take me alive! I will reward you handsomely. My father is rich and has great wealth at home—gold, bronze, and well-worked iron. He will freely give you vast quantities of treasure as my ransom, if he finds out that I am still alive 50 beside your ships.” And these words touched the heart of Menelaus. Right away, he wanted 70 to have his steward take Adrastus back towards the swift Greek ships. But Agamemnon ran up and scolded him. “Soft Menelaus! Why do you take such care of men like him?

Have Trojans always acted with great kindness to you and everybody in your household? Let none of them escape the massacre dealt by our deadly hands, not even one! Even the little babies not yet born, whose mothers carry them inside their bellies, 80 will not escape. All males alive in Troy will die, obliterated all at once, 60 with no one left to care for them.” With this, he changed his brother’s mind, persuading him to do what must be done. So Menelaus pushed brave Adrastus off him with his hand, and mighty Agamemnon stabbed his side. He toppled down, face-up, and Agamemnon, the son of Atreus, stepped on his chest and pulled the ash spear out.

Now you and I are also loving guest-friends, and I will visit you one day in Argos, and you will come to visit me in Lycia, whenever I arrive back home again. So let us now avoid each other’s spears, even amid the thickest battle scrum. Plenty of Trojans and their famous allies are left for me to slaughter, when a god or my quick feet enable me to catch them. And you have many other Greeks to kill 310 whenever you are able. Let us now 230 exchange our arms and armor with each other, so other men will know that we are proud to be each other’s guest-friends through our fathers.”

No pain that anyone in Troy will suffer, not even Hecuba or high king Priam, not even all my many noble brothers, who will be slaughtered by our enemies and fall amid the dust in days to come— no pain of theirs affects me more than yours.

The child was scared by how his father looked, shocked at the terrifying horsehair plume 470 640 that nodded at the top part of his helmet. His loving father and his mother laughed. Hector immediately took off his helmet and put it on the ground. It glittered brightly. Then glorious Hector kissed his darling son and took him in his arms to rock and cuddle and prayed to Zeus and all the other gods, “Zeus and you other gods, please let my son be just like me—admired among the Trojans, strong and successful on the battlefield,

It will be terrible humiliation if none of us will take up Hector’s challenge. 130 I hope you all turn into earth and water, 100 just sitting there, no life or courage in you!

this war and then be free from age and death forever, I would never choose to fight or join the champion fighters at the front, nor would I urge you to participate 400 in war where men win glory. But in fact, a million ways to die stand all around us. No mortal can escape or flee from death. So let us go.
