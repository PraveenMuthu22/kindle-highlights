The hero’s mother, Thetis, and sons of Troy, and Pallas, gave the arms to me. I wish I had not won this contest! For those arms Ajax lies beneath the earth, whose looks and deeds were best of all the Greeks               550 after Achilles, son of Peleus. I spoke to him to try to make it up.

‘Please, Ajax, son of mighty Telamon, can you not set aside your rage at me about those cursed arms? Not even now, in death? The gods made them to ruin us. You were our tower; what a loss you were! We Greeks were struck by grief when you were gone; we mourned as long for you as for Achilles. Blame nobody but Zeus. He ruined us,               560 in hatred for the army of the Greeks; and that was why he brought this doom on you. But listen now, my lord. Subdue your anger.’ He did not answer. He went off and followed the spirits of the dead to Erebus.

‘Great Zeus, and all you other deathless gods, you must punish Odysseus’ men. They killed my cattle! I delighted in those cows all through each day, when I went up to heaven and when I turned to earth. If they do not               380 repay me, I will sink down into Hades and bring my bright light only to the dead.’ Zeus answered, ‘Helius! Please shine with us and shine for mortals on life-giving earth. I will immediately smite their ship with my bright thunderbolt, and smash it up in fragments, all across the wine-dark sea.’

Odysseus replied, his wits about him, “Amphinomus, you seem intelligent, like Nisus of Dulichium, your father; I heard about his wealth and excellence, and that you are his son. You are well-spoken. Take note of what I say. Of all the creatures that live and breathe and creep on earth, we humans               130 are weakest. When the gods bestow on us good fortune, and our legs are spry and limber, we think that nothing can ever can go wrong; but when the gods bring misery and pain, we have to bear our suffering with calm. Our mood depends on what Zeus sends each day. I once had what most people count as wealth, great riches. I committed many crimes, of violence, abuses of my power, abetted by my brothers and my father.               140 No one should turn away from what is right; a man should quietly accept whatever the gods may give. I see how wickedly the suitors are behaving—wasting wealth and failing to respect the wife of one who soon will come back to his family and homeland. Very soon! May spirits guide you home, so you do not meet him when he comes. When he confronts the suitors in this hall there will be blood.”

Within our power he has placed the most important thing, that through which he himself is happy, the power to deal with impressions. For when that capacity is rightly exercised, there is freedom, serenity, cheerfulness, constancy, and there is justice, too, and law, and self-control, and virtue in its entirety. But as to everything else, God hasn’t placed that within our power. It is thus necessary that we, too, should be of one mind with God, and by drawing this distinction, we should seek to obtain by every means those things that lie within our power, but entrust those that don’t lie within our power to the universe, and if it should have need of our children, our country, our body, or anything whatever, be glad to yield it up. 5. Who among us doesn’t admire the saying of Lycurgus* the Spartan? For when he had been blinded in one eye by one of his fellow citizens, and the young man was handed over to him by the people for him to exact whatever vengeance he might wish, he refrained from doing so, but gave him a proper education instead, made a good man of him, and presented him in the theatre; and when the Spartans showed surprise, he said, ‘When I received him from you, this man was offensive and violent, and I’m returning him to you as someone who is well behaved and public-spirited.’ 6. But this above all is the work of nature, to bind together and harmonize our motives with what we conceive to be fitting and beneficial. 7. To suppose that we’ll be viewed with disdain by others if we don’t resort to every means to injure the first enemies we encounter is the mark of thoroughly ignoble and foolish people; for we generally say that someone can be recognized as contemptible by, among other things, his incapacity to do harm, whereas it is much more by his incapacity to do good. 8.

Practise, then, from the very beginning to say to every disagreeable impression, ‘You’re an impression and not at all what you appear to be.’ Then examine it and test it by these rules that you possess, and first and foremost by this one, whether the impression relates to those things that are within our power, or those that aren’t within our power; and if it relates to anything that isn’t within our power, be ready to reply, ‘That’s nothing to me.’ 2.1.

The things that are within our power are by nature free, and immune to hindrance and obstruction, while those that are not within our power are weak, slavish, subject to hindrance, and not our own. 3. Remember, then, that if you regard that which is by nature slavish as being free, and that which is not your own as being your own, you’ll have cause to lament, you’ll have a troubled mind, and you’ll find fault with both gods and human beings; but if you regard only that which is your own as being your own, and that which isn’t your own as not being your own (as is indeed the case), no one will ever be able to coerce you, no one will hinder you, you’ll find fault with no one, you’ll accuse no one, you’ll do nothing whatever against your will, you’ll have no enemy, and no one will ever harm you because no harm can affect you.

Practise, then, from the very beginning to say to every disagreeable impression, ‘You’re an impression and not at all what you appear to be.’ Then examine it and test it by these rules that you possess, and first and foremost by this one, whether the impression relates to those things that are within our power, or those that aren’t within our power; and if it relates to anything that isn’t within our power, be ready to reply, ‘That’s nothing to me.’

3. With regard to everything that is a source of delight to you, or is useful to you, or of which you are fond, remember to keep telling yourself what kind of thing it is, starting with the most insignificant. If you’re fond of a jug, say, ‘This is a jug that I’m fond of,’ and then, if it gets broken, you won’t be upset. If you kiss your child or your wife, say to yourself that it is a human being that you’re kissing; and then, if one of them should die, you won’t be upset.

4. When you’re about to embark on any action, remind yourself what kind of action it is. If you’re going out to take a bath, set before your mind the things that happen at the baths, that people splash you, that people knock up against you, that people steal from you. And you’ll thus undertake the action in a surer manner if you say to yourself at the outset, ‘I want to take a bath and ensure at the same time that my choice remains in harmony with nature.’ And follow the same course in every action that you embark on. So if anything gets in your way while you’re taking your bath, you’ll be ready to tell yourself, ‘Well, this wasn’t the only thing that I wanted to do, but I also wanted to keep my choice in harmony with nature; and I won’t keep it so if I get annoyed at what is happening.’

5. It isn’t the things themselves that disturb people, but the judgements that they form about them. Death, for instance, is nothing terrible, or else it would have seemed so to Socrates too; no, it is in the judgement that death is terrible that the terror lies. So accordingly, whenever we’re impeded, disturbed, or distressed, we should never blame anyone else, but only ourselves, that is to say, our judgements. It is the act of an ill-educated person to cast blame on others when things are going badly for him; one who has taken the first step towards becoming properly educated casts blame on himself; while one who is fully educated casts blame neither on another nor on himself.

Don’t pride yourself on any excellence that is not your own. If a horse were to say in its pride, ‘I’m beautiful,’ that would be bearable; but when you exclaim in your pride, ‘I have a beautiful horse,’ you should be clear in your mind that you’re priding yourself on a good quality that belongs to a horse. What is your own, then? The use of impressions.* So when you’re in harmony with nature through the right use of impressions, you should then be proud of yourself; for then you’ll be taking pride in some good of your own.

[1] “Some things are up to us and some are not. Up to us are judgment, inclination, desire, aversion*1—in short, whatever is our own doing. Not up to us are our bodies, possessions, reputations, public offices—in short, whatever isn’t our own doing.*2 [2] Moreover, the things that are up to us are naturally free, unimpeded, and unobstructed, while the things that aren’t up to us are weak, enslaved, subject to impediment, and not ours.*3 [3] So remember this:*4 if you regard things that are naturally enslaved as free, if you regard things that are not yours as yours, you’ll be obstructed, dejected, and troubled, and you’ll blame both gods and men. But if you regard as yours only what is yours, and as not yours only what is not yours, which is the way things are in reality, no one will ever constrain you, no one will impede you, you’ll blame no one, you’ll reproach no one, you’ll never act reluctantly, no one will harm you, and you’ll have no enemies, because you’ll never suffer harm. [4] “In setting yourself such great goals, then, bear in mind that no moderate effort is required as you set about attaining them. You’ll have to let some things go altogether and postpone others for the time being. But if you want not only these great goals but also political power and wealth, the chances are that, in aiming at the former, you won’t get even the latter; and you’ll certainly fail to get the former,*5 which are the only things from which we get freedom and happiness. [5] So take up the practice right now of telling every disagreeable impression, ‘You’re an impression, and not at all what you appear to be.’ Then go on to examine it and assess it by these criteria of yours, and first and foremost by this one: whether it has to do with the things that are up to us or the things that are not up to us. And if it has to do with the things that are not up to us, have at hand the reminder that it’s nothing to you.”

“Whenever you’re about to start on some activity or other, remind yourself of its characteristic features. If you’re going out to bathe, rehearse in your mind what typically happens in a bathhouse—getting splashed and jostled and abused and robbed. It’s safer to set about an activity if you tell yourself: ‘I want to bathe and to keep my will in accord with nature’—and so on for every activity. Then, if something happens that obstructs your bathing, you’ll have at hand the reminder that ‘That wasn’t the only thing I wanted; I also wanted to keep my will in accord with nature. And I won’t be doing that if I resent what’s happening.’”

“People are troubled not by things but by their judgments about things. Death, for example, isn’t frightening, or else Socrates would have thought it so.*13 No, what frightens people is their judgment about death, that it’s something to fear. So whenever we’re obstructed or troubled or distressed, let’s blame no one but ourselves—that is, our judgments.” 5b “Blaming others when things are going badly for him is what an uneducated person does.

“It’s possible to understand what nature wants from situations where we’re no different from other people. For example, when a slave breaks someone else’s cup, we’re instantly ready to say ‘These things happen.’ So when it’s a cup of yours that gets broken, appreciate that you should have the same attitude as when it’s someone else’s cup. Transfer the principle to things of greater importance. Has someone else’s child or wife died? There’s no one who wouldn’t say ‘So it goes.’ But when it’s one’s own child or wife who’s died, the automatic response is ‘Oh, no!’ and ‘Poor me!’ It’s essential to remember how we feel when we hear of this happening to others.”

Otherwise, you’ll make an enthusiastic start, because you won’t have given any thought to what comes next, and then later you’ll shamefully†4 abandon the project when faced with some of the consequences. [2] You’d like to be a victor at the Olympic Games? Good heavens, so would I! That would really be fine! But consider the project from start to finish before setting about it. You have to be disciplined, maintain a strict diet, give up sweet pastries, undergo a strict training regime, exercise regularly every day however hot or cold it may be, refrain from cold drinks, drink no wine except when prescribed. In short, you have to submit to a trainer as you would to a doctor. Then, during the contest, you have to wield a spade,*34†5 risk dislocating a wrist or spraining an ankle, swallow a lot of sand, possibly get flogged,*35 and, as if all that wasn’t enough, possibly suffer defeat as well. [3] “Once you’ve taken all this into consideration, go and compete if you still want to. If you don’t, your behavior will be comparable to that of children, who at one moment pretend they’re wrestlers and at another gladiators, then they’re blowing trumpets, and then they’re actors in a play. That’s what you’re like as well: at one moment an athlete, at the next a gladiator, then an orator, then a philosopher—without committing yourself wholeheartedly to anything. Like an ape, you imitate every passing thing you see, and one thing after another attracts you. You don’t think through any of your projects or look at them in the round; you act without purpose and without really wanting anything. [4] “This is no different from how some people, after seeing a philosopher and hearing one of them speaking as persuasively as Euphrates*36 (not that anyone can really speak like him), want to take up philosophy themselves. [5] Man, first consider what kind of venture it is and then your own nature, to see if you’ve got what it takes. You’d like to be a pentathlete or a wrestler?

As a philosopher, you have to go without sleep, work hard, and withdraw from friends and family; you’ll find yourself sneered at by slaves, mocked by everyone, and inferior in everything—in honor, in political power, in the courts, and in every worldly enterprise. [7] Once you’ve taken all this into consideration, see if you want to exchange these external things for equanimity, freedom, and peace of mind. And if you don’t, steer clear of philosophy. Don’t act as children do and be a philosopher today, a tax collector tomorrow, then an orator, and then an imperial procurator.*38 These things don’t fit well together. You must be one person, whether good or bad. You have to choose between cultivating your†6 command center*39 or the outside world—between exercising your ingenuity on inner things or outer things, or in other words between taking up a stance as a philosopher or as a man of the world.”

What is it that I want? To understand nature and make it my guide. So I look for someone to explain things to me, and because I’ve heard that Chrysippus does that, I turn to him. But I don’t understand what he’s written, so I look for someone to interpret it. So far, nothing to be proud of. But when I’ve found an interpreter, there’s still the matter of putting the precepts into practice; that’s the only thing to be proud of. But if what I prize is just the interpreting itself, haven’t I ended up as a literary critic rather than a philosopher, with the only difference being that I explicate Chrysippus rather than Homer?

He stretched out his neck and was struck, but the blow was feeble and he reacted to it by shrinking back a little—but then he stretched it out again. [20] And before that, when Epaphroditus went up to him and asked him about his conflict with Nero, he said, ‘If I have anything to say, I’ll speak to your master.’

[1] “For a rational being, the only unbearable thing is unreasonableness, but anything reasonable is bearable. [2] Being beaten isn’t in itself unbearable.” “What do you mean?” “Look at it this way: the Spartans submit to being flogged once they’ve realized that it’s a reasonable thing to do.”*83 [3] “But being hanged is unbearable, isn’t it?” “Except that when a person feels that it’s a reasonable thing to do, he’ll go and hang himself. [4] In short, if we look carefully, we’ll find that nothing distresses a rational being as much as what is unreasonable and, conversely, that nothing attracts it as much as what is reasonable. [5] But people’s views of what’s reasonable and unreasonable differ, just as their views of good and bad do, and what is or is not expedient. [6] This, above all, is why we need education, so that we learn how to adjust our preconceptions of what’s reasonable and unreasonable until they fit particular instances in a way that conforms with nature.*84 [7] “In order to determine what is and isn’t reasonable, we not only take account of the values of external things, but each of us also takes his role into consideration.

[12] “That’s why, when Florus was wondering whether or not he should attend Nero’s theatrical spectacle*87 and even play a part in it himself, Agrippinus said, ‘Go!’ [13] But when Florus asked him why he wasn’t going himself, Agrippinus replied, ‘Because I don’t even stop to consider it.’ [14] The point is that, as soon as someone starts to deliberate about this kind of thing, weighing up the relative values of externals and making a decision on that basis, he’s not far off being one of those people who are unaware of his own role. [15] I mean, what are you asking me? Which is preferable, death or life? Life, of course. Pain or pleasure? Pleasure, of course. [16] ‘But if I refuse to take part in the tragedy, I’ll lose my head.’ ‘Go ahead, then. Take part. But I won’t.’ [17] ‘Why me and not you?’ ‘Because you’re thinking of yourself as just one thread in the toga.’ ‘Meaning what?’ ‘You’re bound to care about how to be similar to other people, just as a thread too wants to be no different from all the other threads. [18] But I’d like to be purple, the little bit of brightness that makes all the rest seem fair and lovely.*88 So why are you telling me to conform to the majority? How, in that case, would I be purple?’ [19] “Helvidius Priscus saw this, too, and acted on the insight. When Vespasian told him not to attend a meeting of the Senate, he replied, ‘You have the power to disqualify me as a senator, but as long as I am one, I’m obliged to attend meetings.’ [20] ‘All right, then, attend the meeting,’ says Vespasian, ‘but don’t say anything.’ ‘Don’t ask me for my opinion and I’ll keep quiet.’ ‘But I’m bound to ask you.’*89 ‘And I’m bound to say what seems right.’ [21] ‘But if you speak, I’ll have you killed.’ ‘Did I ever tell you that I was immortal? You do your job and I’ll do mine. Yours is to put me to death and mine to die fearlessly. Yours is to send me into exile and mine to leave without grieving.’*90 [22] “So did Priscus do any good? After all, he was just a single individual. But what ‘good’ does the purple do the toga? All it does is stand out in it as purple and serve as a model of beauty for the rest of the threads. [23] If someone else had been told by Caesar in such circumstances not to attend a meeting of the Senate, he’d have said, ‘Thank you for letting me off.’ [24] Not that Caesar would have stopped that sort of person from attending. He’d have known that he’d either just have sat there like a stoppered jug or, if he did open his mouth, it would only be to say what he knew Caesar wished him to say, and even improve on

[30] Someone asked, “So how will each of us come to realize what is in accord with his own role?” “How is it,” Epictetus replied, “that on the approach of a lion only the bull is aware of his aptitude and takes up a forward position in defense of the whole herd? It’s obvious, isn’t it, that the possession of aptitude is directly and simultaneously accompanied by awareness of it? [31] The same goes for us too: if any of us has such aptitude, he won’t be unaware of it. [32] But a bull doesn’t get to be a bull overnight, and a person doesn’t acquire excellence all at once either. Winter training is called for;*94 one has to be prepared and not rush into situations for which one is ill suited.

But it may be that exceptional greatness belongs to others, to Socrates and others like him.” [34] “So if we’re equipped by our natures for greatness, why don’t all of us, or even many of us, achieve it?” “Does every horse turn out swift? Does every hound become a good hunter? [35] Well, then, am I to stop trying just because I lack natural ability? Perish the thought! [36] Epictetus won’t be a greater man than Socrates, but I’m satisfied with his not being too bad.†10 [37] I won’t be Milo, either, but that doesn’t mean I neglect my body.*95 Nor will I be Croesus, but that doesn’t mean I neglect my possessions.*96 In short, in any field of endeavor, we don’t let the recognition that we won’t reach the peak make us stop trying.”

Letter 1 (Book I.1) In answer to Lucilius, who has declared himself determined to make the best use of his time. Yes, do just that, dear Lucilius:* liberate yourself, and gather and save 1 up the time which until now was being taken from you by force or stealth or simply slipping away unnoticed. Convince yourself that the situation is as I describe it; some periods of time are snatched from us, some are stolen, and some simply seep away. Yet the most shameful loss is the loss due to carelessness. Indeed, if you consider things attentively, the greatest part* of life slips away in failure, a great part in futility, and all of it in distraction. Name anyone to me who puts a price on time, who values the day, 2 who understands that he is dying each and every day. For we deceive ourselves by looking for death ahead of us, whereas a great part of death has already taken place. Whatever part of life is behind us is possessed by death. So, dear Lucilius, do what you say you are doing and embrace every hour; in this way you will have to depend less on tomorrow if you seize hold of today. While life is being postponed, it rushes past. Everything else is beyond our grasp, only time is ours. Nature pro- 3 duced us to claim ownership only of this one fl eeting and slippery property, from which anyone who chooses may dispossess us. And men’s stupidity is so great that they allow the most trivial cheap objects, ones easy to replace, to be charged against their credit once they have obtained them. But no one thinks he owes anything when he has received a gift of time. And yet this is the only thing that even a grateful person cannot return. You may wonder how I myself am 4 dealing with this, since I am making these recommendations to you. I will confess honestly that the sum of my expenses is accounted for, as happens to anyone indulgent but careful. I cannot say I am not making any losses, but I can say what I am losing and why and how.

When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.

Since completing his journal of reflections on philosophy several years earlier, Marcus has been passing through the final stage of a lifelong spiritual journey. Now lying in pain and discomfort, nearing the end, he gently reminds himself that he has already died many times along the way. First of all, Marcus the child died as he entered the imperial palace as heir to the throne, assuming the title Caesar after Hadrian passed away. After Antoninus passed away, Marcus the young Caesar had to die when he took his place as emperor of Rome. Leaving Rome behind to take command of the northern legions during the Marcomannic Wars signaled another death: a transition to a life of warfare and a sojourn in a foreign land. Now, as an old man, he faces his death not for the first time but for the last. From the moment we’re born we’re constantly dying, not only with each stage of life but also one day at a time. Our bodies are no longer the ones to which our mothers gave birth, as Marcus put it. Nobody is the same person he was yesterday. Realizing this makes it easier to let go: we can no more hold on to life than grasp the waters of a rushing stream.

5. Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.

reason out of a kind of pain and inner convulsion. But the man motivated by desire, who is mastered by pleasure, seems somehow more self-indulgent, less manly in his sins. Theophrastus is right, and philosophically sound, to say that the sin committed out of pleasure deserves a harsher rebuke than the one committed out of pain. The angry man is more like a victim of wrongdoing, provoked by pain to anger. The other man rushes into wrongdoing on his own, moved to action by desire. 11. You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn’t harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful—and hence neither good nor bad.

Don't let yourself worry with thoughts like "If I don't manage my business, I'll go hungry" or "If I don't correct others' behaviour, they'll misbehave." It's better to die hungry but peaceful than to live wealthy with anxiety. It's better to let others make their mistakes than to lose your own happiness. Start practicing with small issues. If someone spills something or takes something of yours, remind yourself: "This is what I pay for keeping my calm and peace. Everything has its cost." When you ask someone to do something, remember they might not listen or might do it wrong. But don't let your inner peace depend on how others behave.

Isn't it true that getting a prestigious position or being invited to important social events isn't really your business? Of course not. So why should lack of these things dishonor you?

It may seem natural to assume that pain is intrinsically bad, but the Stoics employ a barrage of arguments to persuade their followers that pain and pleasure are neither good nor bad. For instance, one way of illustrating the indifference of pain would be to point out that, like other externals, pain can be used either wisely or foolishly, for good or for bad. An athlete might learn to endure the pain and discomfort of extreme physical exertion. In that case, deliberately exposing themselves through hard exercise to painful, or at least uncomfortable, sensations might be something beneficial insofar as it helps them to build endurance. Of course, someone who avoids discomfort is probably going to avoid strenuous exercise. Pain and discomfort can become advantages in life if they provide opportunities for us to develop our strengths. It’s also true that many ordinary people, at certain times, exhibit indifference to pain—such as when they’re injured while saving their own life. Some people, of course, such as masochists, even enjoy the sensation of pain. Pain is just a sensation, in other words; what matters is how we choose to respond to it.

Epictetus tells his students that it’s one thing to have a pain in the head or in the ear, but they should not go a step further and say, “I have a pain in the head—alas!” They shouldn’t imply that the pain is some kind of catastrophe. He explained that he wasn’t denying them the right to groan, just that they shouldn’t do so inwardly by actually buying into the notion that they’ve been harmed.

Stoic strategies for bearing pain and illness by viewing them with studied indifference. Most of these strategies were influenced by the Discourses of Epictetus. 1. Separate your mind from the sensation, which I call “cognitive distancing,” by reminding yourself that it is not things, or sensations, that upset us but our judgments about them. 2. Remember that the fear of pain does more harm than pain itself, or use other forms of functional analysis to weigh up the consequences for you of fearing versus accepting pain. 3. View bodily sensations objectively (objective representation, or phantasia kataleptike) instead of describing them in emotive terms. (“There’s a feeling of pressure around my forehead” versus “It feels like I’m dying—an elephant might as well be stamping over and over on my head!”) 4. Analyze the sensations into their elements and limit them as precisely as possible to their specific site on the body, thereby using the same depreciation by analysis that we used in the previous chapter to neutralize unhealthy desires and cravings. (“There’s a sharp throbbing sensation in my ear that comes and goes,” not “I’m in total agony.”) 5. View the sensation as limited in time, changeable, and transient, or “contemplate impermanence.” (“This sensation only peaks for a few seconds at a time and then fades away; it will probably be gone in a couple of days.”) If you have an acute problem like toothache, you’ll have forgotten what it felt like years from now. If you have a long-term problem such as chronic sciatica, you’ll know it sometimes gets worse and so at other times it must be less severe. It makes a difference if you can focus on the notion that this shall pass. 6. Let go of your struggle against the sensation and accept it as natural and indifferent, what is called “Stoic acceptance.” That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take practical steps to deal with it, such as using medication to reduce pain, but you must learn to live with the pain without resentment or an emotional struggle. 7. Remind yourself that Nature has given you both the capacity to exercise courage and the endurance to rise above pain and that we admire these virtues in other people, which we discussed in relation to contemplating and modeling virtue. We’ll look at each of these strategies in turn.

The most important pain-management strategy mentioned by Epictetus and Marcus is the one we’ve called “cognitive distancing.” It’s summed up in a phrase that will already be familiar to you: “It’s not events that upset us but our judgments about events.”17 If we apply that to the concept of pain, it means that the pain isn’t what upsets us but rather our judgments about it. When we suspend the activity of assigning value judgments to the pain, our suffering is alleviated. It’s always within our power to do this in any situation—it’s up to us how much importance we choose to invest in bodily sensations.

Marcus describes the suspension of value judgments as the “withdrawal,” “separation,” or “purification” (katharsis) of the mind from, in this case, bodily sensations of pain and illness. He also likes to explain the suspension of judgment by saying that pain and pleasure should be left where they stand, in the parts of the body to which they belong. Even if the body, the closest companion of the mind, is “cut or burned, or festers or decays,” we can preserve our ruling faculty in a peaceful state as long as we don’t judge bodily sensations as being intrinsically good or bad.

Marcus also calls this being “indifferent to indifferent things.”19 There’s a particularly important passage where he spells out the subtleties of Stoic psychology in this regard.20 We should keep our ruling faculty undisturbed by external things, including bodily sensations of pain and pleasure. He says this means not allowing it to unite with them but rather drawing a line around the mind, marking its boundaries, with bodily sensations on the other side, as if viewed from a distance—over there. On the other hand, when we allow ourselves to make strong value judgments about external sensations such as pain, we merge our minds with them and lose ourselves in the experience of suffering.

It’s important to note that Marcus isn’t asking us to deny that pain (or pleasure, for that matter) is part of life, even for the Stoic wise man. He notes that sensations of pain and pleasure will inevitably find their way into our consciousness because of the natural sympathy that exists between the mind and the body. He stresses that you should not try to suppress the sensations, because they are natural, and you should not assign judgments to them as good or bad, helpful or harmful. This delicate balance is central to modern mindfulness and acceptance-based cognitive therapy, which teaches clients neither to suppress unpleasant feelings nor to worry about them. Instead, you should learn to accept them while remaining detached from them.

For Marcus, what matters is that we stop looking at pain and illness through the lens of harm. Those judgments originate within us. They are projected outward onto bodily sensations and other external events. It’s important to remember that whether we view something as helpful or harmful depends entirely upon our goals. Most people take for granted assumptions they have about their goals in life, so much so that they are rarely aware of them. If my goal is to look handsome, then if I break my nose, I’m bound to view it as harmful rather than helpful. But if my most cherished goal is survival and I break my nose while narrowly escaping certain death, I’d probably view it with relative indifference. The Stoics want us to go through a radical upheaval in our underlying values so that our supreme goal is to live with wisdom and its accompanying virtues. They want us to treat physical pain and injuries with indifference. In fact, these misfortunes can even provide an opportunity for us to exercise greater wisdom and strength of character. Marcus tells himself: Do away with the judgment, and the notion “I have been harmed” is done away with; do away with that notion, and the harm itself is gone.

So do the Stoics not care at all about physical health? Yes, they do. They classify it as a preferred indifferent. It’s natural and reasonable for us to prefer health to sickness. Physical health provides us with more opportunity to exercise our will and influence external events in life. In itself, health is not really good or bad. It’s more like an opportunity. A foolish person may squander the advantages good health provides by indulging in his vices. A wise and good person, by contrast, may use both health and illness as opportunities to exercise virtue.

analysis”). Given that suffering arises from our negative value judgments, the Stoics say that the fear of pain does us far more harm than pain itself because it injures our very character. Pain, by contrast, is harmless if you learn to accept it with an attitude of indifference. Epictetus stated this very succinctly: “For death or pain is not fearsome, but rather the fear of pain or death.”25 To live life fully, you have to get out of your comfort zone, as we say today. Fear of pain makes cowards out of us all and limits our sphere of life.

It’s important to have a firm grasp of a behavior’s negative consequences if we want to change it. For example, blood phobia might prevent someone from having medical tests they require—for some women it’s even an obstacle to giving birth. Indeed, most people are frightened of pain and illness to varying degrees. Realizing that fear of pain may be doing you more harm than the pain itself can motivate you to start regularly practicing the psychological skills required to overcome intolerance of pain and discomfort.

It may seem natural to assume that pain is intrinsically bad, but the Stoics employ a barrage of arguments to persuade their followers that pain and pleasure are neither good nor bad. For instance, one way of illustrating the indifference of pain would be to point out that, like other externals, pain can be used either wisely or foolishly, for good or for bad. An athlete might learn to endure the pain and discomfort of extreme physical exertion. In that case, deliberately exposing themselves through hard exercise to painful, or at least uncomfortable, sensations might be something beneficial insofar as it helps them to build endurance. Of course, someone who avoids discomfort is probably going to avoid strenuous exercise. Pain and discomfort can become advantages in life if they provide opportunities for us to develop our strengths. It’s also true that many ordinary people, at certain times, exhibit indifference to pain—such as when they’re injured while saving their own life. Some people, of course, such as masochists, even enjoy the sensation of pain. Pain is just a sensation, in other words; what matters is how we choose to respond to it.

Epictetus tells his students how to cope with pain and illness several times in the Discourses. Like Epicurus before him, he believed that complaining and chattering too much about our problems just makes them worse, and, more importantly, it harms our character. Marcus agreed that collective whining is bad for the soul: “No joining others in their wailing, no violent emotion.”16 Modern cognitive therapists likewise find that distress escalates when people tell themselves “I can’t cope!” Their distress lessens when they begin looking at things more rationally and objectively and acknowledge various ways they can potentially cope now or have coped in a similar situation in the past.

He explained that he wasn’t denying them the right to groan, just that they shouldn’t do so inwardly by actually buying into the notion that they’ve been harmed.

He summed up his practical advice by telling his students to respond to troubling events or unpleasant sensations by literally saying This is nothing to me. This perhaps overstates things. Stoics can still “prefer” to avoid pain and illness when possible. Once it’s already happening, though, they try to accept the fact with indifference.
